# Basic-Numpy-Practice
Numpy stores data of same types so it is very fast,  It is made to deal with numeric data mostly  It serves as a replacement for matlab  It is good to so many mathematics operations.  It is the base of pandas, matplotlib etc.


we can store multiple types of arrays

like 1D, 2D, 3D , 4D etc.

and various operations of slicing just as seen in list objects can be done there as well.
