# Basic-Numpy-Practice
Numpy stores data of same types so it is very fast,  It is made to deal with numeric data mostly  It serves as a replacement for matlab  It is good to so many mathematics operations.  It is the base of pandas, matplotlib etc.


we can store multiple types of arrays

like 1D, 2D, 3D , 4D etc.

and various operations of slicing just as seen in list objects can be done there as well.

And it comes with so many packages such as np.random.permuation, np.arange, .reshape() etc. to name same

We can create matrices and join them horizontally, vertically and a lot of other operations.

and the best thing it is super fast than anything.
